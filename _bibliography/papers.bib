 abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) is critical for the repair of double strand breaks and broken replication forks. Although HR is mostly error free, inherent or environmental conditions that either suppress or induce HR cause genomic instability. Despite its importance in carcinogenesis, due to limitations in our ability to detect HR in vivo, little is known about HR in mammalian tissues. Here, we describe a mouse model in which a direct repeat HR substrate is targeted to the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus. In the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-GFP (RaDR-GFP) mice, HR between two truncated EGFP expression cassettes can yield a fluorescent signal. In-house image analysis software provides a rapid method for quantifying recombination events within intact tissues, and the frequency of recombinant cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry. A comparison among 11 tissues shows that the frequency of recombinant cells varies by more than two orders of magnitude among tissues, wherein HR in the brain is the lowest. Additionally, de novo recombination events accumulate with age in the colon, showing that this mouse model can be used to study the impact of chronic exposures on genomic stability. Exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, an alkylating agent similar to the cancer chemotherapeutic temozolomide, shows that the colon, liver and pancreas are susceptible to DNA damage-induced HR. Finally, histological analysis of the underlying cell types reveals that pancreatic acinar cells and liver hepatocytes undergo HR and also that HR can be specifically detected in colonic somatic stem cells. Taken together, the RaDR-GFP mouse model provides new understanding of how tissue and age impact susceptibility to HR, and enables future studies of genetic, environmental and physiological factors that modulate HR in mammals. },

Images acquired through a standard imaging Fourier transform spectrometer do not have the depth-resolution. By post processing the spectral cubes (x, y, Î») obtained through a Sagnac interferometer under uniform illumination and structured illumination, spectrally resolved images with depth resolution can be recovered using structured light illumination algorithms such as the HiLo method. The proposed scheme is validated with in vitro specimens including fluorescent solution and fluorescent beads with known spectra. The system is further demonstrated in quantifying spectra from 3D resolved features in biological specimens.

 abstract = {A high throughput 3D image cytometer have been developed that improves imaging speed by an order of magnitude over current technologies. This imaging speed improvement was realized by combining several key components. First, a depth-resolved image can be rapidly generated using a structured light reconstruction algorithm that requires only two wide field images, one with uniform illumination and the other with structured illumination. Second, depth scanning is implemented using the high speed remote depth scanning. Finally, the large field of view, high NA objective lens and the high pixelation, high frame rate sCMOS camera enable high resolution, high sensitivity imaging of a large cell population. This system can image at 800 cell/sec in 3D at submicron resolution corresponding to imaging 1 million cells in 20 min. The statistical accuracy of this instrument is verified by quantitatively measuring rare cell populations with ratio ranging from 1:1 to 1:10(5) .

 abstract = {Imaging Fourier-transform spectroscopy (IFTS) is a powerful method for biological hyperspectral analysis based on various imaging modalities, such as fluorescence or Raman. Since the measurements are taken in the Fourier space of the spectrum, it can also take advantage of compressed sensing strategies. IFTS has been readily implemented in high-throughput, high-content microscope systems based on wide-field imaging modalities. However, there are limitations in existing wide-field IFTS designs. Non-common-path approaches are less phase-stable. Alternatively, designs based on the common-path Sagnac interferometer are stable, but incompatible with high-throughput imaging. They require exhaustive sequential scanning over large interferometric path delays, making compressive strategic data acquisition impossible. In this paper, we present a novel phase-stable, near-common-path interferometer enabling high-throughput hyperspectral imaging based on strategic data acquisition. Our results suggest that this approach can improve throughput over those of many other wide-field spectral techniques by more than an order of magnitude without compromising phase stability.},

 abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) events are key drivers of cancer-promoting mutations, and the ability to visualize these events in situ provides important information regarding mutant cell type, location, and clonal expansion. We have previously created the Rosa26Direct Repeat (RaDR) mouse model wherein HR at an integrated substrate gives rise to a fluorescent cell. To fully leverage this inÂ situ approach, we need better ways to quantify rare fluorescent cells deep within tissues. Here, we present a robust, automated event quantification algorithm that uses image intensity and gradient features to detect fluorescent cells in deep tissue specimens. To analyze the performance of our algorithm, we simulate fluorescence behavior in tissue using Monte Carlo methods. Importantly, this approach reduces the potential for bias in manual counting and enables quantification of samples with highly dense HR events. Using this approach, we measured the relative frequency of HR within a chromosome and between chromosomes and found that HR within a chromosome is more frequent, which is consistent with the close proximity of sister chromatids. Our approach is both objective and highly rapid, providing a powerful tool, not only to researchers interested in HR, but also to many other researchers who are similarly using fluorescence as a marker for understanding mammalian biology in tissues.},

However, the image contrast taken by LineTFM is lower than that by TPLSM because LineTFM is severely influenced by biological tissue scattering. To reject the scattered photons, we implemented LineTFM using both structured illumination and uniform illumination combined with the HiLo post-processing algorithm, called HiLL microscopy (HiLo-Line-scanning temporal focusing microscopy). HiLL microscopy significantly reduces tissue scattering and improves image contrast. We demonstrate HiLL microscopy with <i>in vivo</i> brain imaging.

 abstract = {From multi-photon imaging penetrating millimeters deep through scattering
biological tissue, to super-resolution imaging conquering the diffraction
limit, optical imaging techniques have greatly advanced in recent years.
Notwithstanding, a key unmet challenge in all these imaging techniques is to
perform rapid wide-field imaging through a turbid medium. Strategies such as
active wave-front correction and multi-photon excitation, both used for deep
tissue imaging; or wide-field total-internal-refection illumination, used for
super-resolution imaging; can generate arbitrary excitation patterns over a
large field-of-view through or under turbid media. In these cases, throughput
advantage gained by wide-field excitation is lost due to the use of point
detection. To address this challenge, here we introduce a novel technique
called De-scattering with Excitation Patterning, or 'DEEP', which uses
patterned excitation followed by wide-field detection with computational
imaging. We use two-photon temporal focusing (TFM) to demonstrate our approach
at multiple scattering lengths deep in tissue. Our results suggest that
millions of point-scanning measurements could be substituted with tens to
hundreds of DEEP measurements with no compromise in image quality.},

@article{pub.1123793778,
 abstract = {Today the gold standard for in vivo imaging through scattering tissue is the
point-scanning two-photon microscope (PSTPM). Especially in neuroscience, PSTPM
is widely used for deep-tissue imaging in the brain. However, due to sequential
scanning, PSTPM is slow. Temporal focusing microscopy (TFM), on the other hand,
focuses femtosecond pulsed laser light temporally, while keeping wide-field
illumination, and is consequently much faster. However, due to the use of a
camera detector, TFM suffers from the scattering of emission photons. As a
result, TFM produces images of poor spatial resolution and signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), burying fluorescent signals from small structures such as
dendritic spines. In this work, we present a data-driven deep learning approach
to improve resolution and SNR of TFM images. Using a 3D convolutional neural
network (CNN) we build a map from TFM to PSTPM modalities, to enable fast TFM
imaging while maintaining high-resolution through scattering media. We
demonstrate this approach for in vivo imaging of dendritic spines on pyramidal
neurons in the mouse visual cortex. We show that our trained network rapidly
outputs high-resolution images that recover biologically relevant features
previously buried in the scattered fluorescence in the TFM images. In vivo
imaging that combines TFM and the proposed 3D convolution neural network is one
to two orders of magnitude faster than PSTPM but retains the high resolution
and SNR necessary to analyze small fluorescent structures. The proposed 3D
convolution deep network could also be potentially beneficial for improving the
performance of many speed-demanding deep-tissue imaging applications such as in
vivo voltage imaging.},

 abstract = {Inflammation is a major risk factor for many types of cancer, including colorectal. There are two fundamentally different mechanisms by which inflammation can contribute to carcinogenesis. First, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) can damage DNA to cause mutations that initiate cancer. Second, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promote proliferation, migration, and invasion. Although it is known that inflammation-associated RONS can be mutagenic, the extent to which they induce mutations in intestinal stem cells has been little explored. Furthermore, it is now widely accepted that cancer is caused by successive rounds of clonal expansion with associated de novo mutations that further promote tumor development. As such, we aimed to understand the extent to which inflammation promotes clonal expansion in normal and tumor tissue. Using an engineered mouse model that is prone to cancer and within which mutant cells fluoresce, here we have explored the impact of inflammation on de novo mutagenesis and clonal expansion in normal and tumor tissue. While inflammation is strongly associated with susceptibility to cancer and a concomitant increase in the overall proportion of mutant cells in the tissue, we did not observe an increase in mutations in normal adjacent tissue. These results are consistent with opportunities for de novo mutations and clonal expansion during tumor growth, and they suggest protective mechanisms that suppress the risk of inflammation-induced accumulation of mutant cells in normal tissue.},

To understand how gene-environment interactions impact disease susceptibility, we studied Aag âˆ’/âˆ’ and Aag -overexpressing mice that harbor increased levels of either replication-blocking lesions (3-methyladenine, or 3MeA) or strand breaks (BER intermediates), respectively. Remarkably, the disease outcome switched from cancer to lethality simply by changing AAG levels. To understand the underlying basis for this observation, we integrated a suite of molecular, cellular and physiological analyses. We found that unrepaired 3MeA is somewhat toxic but highly mutagenic (promoting cancer), whereas excess strand breaks are poorly mutagenic and highly toxic (suppressing cancer and promoting lethality). We demonstrate that the levels of a single DNA repair protein tips the balance between blocks and breaks, and thus dictates the disease consequences of DNA damage. },

To understand the underlying basis for this observation, we integrate a suite of molecular, cellular, and physiological analyses. We find that unrepaired 3MeA is somewhat toxic, but highly mutagenic (promoting cancer), whereas excess strand breaks are poorly mutagenic and highly toxic (suppressing cancer and promoting lethality). We demonstrate that the levels of a single DNA repair protein tip the balance between blocks and breaks and thus dictate the disease consequences of DNA damage.},

 abstract = {Nonlinear optical microscopy has enabled in vivo deep tissue imaging on the millimeter scale. A key unmet challenge is its limited throughput especially compared to rapid wide-field modalities that are used ubiquitously in thin specimens. Wide-field imaging methods in tissue specimens have found successes in optically cleared tissues and at shallower depths, but the scattering of emission photons in thick turbid samples severely degrades image quality at the camera. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel technique called De-scattering with Excitation Patterning or "DEEP," which uses patterned nonlinear excitation followed by computational imaging-assisted wide-field detection. Multiphoton temporal focusing allows high-resolution excitation patterns to be projected deep inside specimen at multiple scattering lengths due to the use of long wavelength light. Computational reconstruction allows high-resolution structural features to be reconstructed from tens to hundreds of DEEP images instead of millions of point-scanning measurements.},

@article{pub.1143590908,
 abstract = {Abstract A key challenge in optical microscopy is to image fast at high-resolution. To address this problem, we propose â€œPhysics Augmented U-Netâ€, which combines deep learning and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). In SIM, the structured illumination aliases out-of-band high-frequencies to the passband of the microscope; thus SIM captures some high-frequencies even when the image is sampled at low-resolution. To utilize these features, we propose a three-element method: 1) a modified U-Net model, 2) a physics-based forward model of SIM 3) an inference algorithm combining the two models. The modified U-Net architecture is similar to the seminal work, but the bottleneck is modified by concatenating two latent vectors, one encoding low-frequencies (LFLV), and the other encoding high-frequencies (HFLV). LFLV is learned by U-Net contracting path, and HFLV is learned by a second encoding path. In the inference mode, the high-frequency encoder is removed; HFLV is then optimized to fit the measured microscopy images to the output of the forward model for the generated image by the U-Net. We validated our method on two different datasets under different experimental conditions. Since a latent vector is optimized instead of a 2D image, the inference mode is less computationally complex. The proposed model is also more stable compared to other generative prior-based methods. Finally, as the forward model is independent of the U-Net, Physics Augmented U-Net can enhance resolution on any variation of SIM without further retraining.},

Learning based methods have achieved greater success in compression and image
quality. However, the information loss in the acquisition process sets the
compression bounds. Further improvement in compression, without compromising
the reconstruction quality is thus a challenge. In this work, we propose
differentiable compressive fluorescence microscopy ($\partial \mu$) which
includes a realistic generalizable forward model with learnable-physical

model. The cascaded model is end-to-end differentiable and can learn optimal
compressive sampling schemes through training data. With our model, we
performed thousands of numerical experiments on various compressive microscope
configurations. Our results suggest that learned sampling outperforms widely
used traditional compressive sampling schemes at higher compressions ($\times
100- 1000$) in terms of reconstruction quality. We further utilize our

phase microscopy (QPM) is a powerful label-free imaging modality. Despite
significant advances in fast multiplexed imaging sensors and

 abstract = {Computational optical imaging (COI) systems leverage optical coding elements
(CE) in their setups to encode a high-dimensional scene in a single or multiple
snapshots and decode it by using computational algorithms. The performance of
COI systems highly depends on the design of its main components: the CE pattern
and the computational method used to perform a given task. Conventional
approaches rely on random patterns or analytical designs to set the
distribution of the CE. However, the available data and algorithm capabilities
of deep neural networks (DNNs) have opened a new horizon in CE data-driven
designs that jointly consider the optical encoder and computational decoder.
Specifically, by modeling the COI measurements through a fully differentiable
image formation model that considers the physics-based propagation of light and
its interaction with the CEs, the parameters that define the CE and the
computational decoder can be optimized in an end-to-end (E2E) manner. Moreover,
by optimizing just CEs in the same framework, inference tasks can be performed
from pure optics. This work surveys the recent advances on CE data-driven
design and provides guidelines on how to parametrize different optical elements
to include them in the E2E framework. Since the E2E framework can handle
different inference applications by changing the loss function and the DNN, we
present low-level tasks such as spectral imaging reconstruction or high-level
tasks such as pose estimation with privacy preserving enhanced by using optimal
task-based optical architectures. Finally, we illustrate classification and 3D
object recognition applications performed at the speed of the light using

@article{pub.1149340127,
 abstract = {Abstract The current state-of-the-art infection and antimicrobial resistance diagnostics (AMR) is based mainly on culture-based methods with detection time of 48-96 hours. Slow diagnoses lead to adverse patient outcomes that directly correlate with the time taken to administer optimal antimicrobial. Mortality risk doubles with a 24-hour delay in providing appropriate antibiotics in cases of bacteremia. It is therefore essential to develop novel methods that can promptly and accurately diagnose microbial infections both at species and strain levels in clinical settings. Here, we demonstrate that the complimentary use of label-free optical assay with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can enable high-speed culture-free diagnosis of AMR. Our assay is based on microscopy methods exploiting label free highly sensitive quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) followed by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based classification. We benchmarked our proposed workflow on twenty-one clinical isolates from four WHO priority pathogens that were antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) phenotyped and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profile was determined by WGS. The proposed optical assay is in good agreement with the WGS characterization. Highly accurate classification based on the gram staining (100% for gramnegative and 83.4% for gram-positive), species (98.64), and wild-type/non-wild type (96.45%), as well as at the individual strain level (100% accurate in predicting 18 out of the 21 strains). These results demonstrate the potential of the QPM assay as a rapid and first-stage tool for species, resistance, and strain-level classification, which WGS can follow up for confirmation. Taken together, all this information is of high clinical importance. Such a workflow can facilitate efficient antimicrobial stewardship and prevent the spread of AMR.},
